# Data Cleaning

Data cleaning is the first step in data analytics and data science. It's like tidying up messy data so it's accurate and useful before you begin analysis. This involves fixing errors, removing duplicates, and making sure everything looks consistent. When data is clean, it's easier to find insights and make good decisions.

# Overview

Whenever we have to work with a real world dataset, the first problem that we face is to clean it. The real world dataset never comes clean. It consists lot of discrepancies in the dataset. So, we have to clean the dataset for further processing.

Cleaning data is the process of preparing the dataset for analysis. It is very important because the accuracy of analysis, machine learning or data mining models are affected because of poor quality of data.

So, data analyst and scientists spend a large amount of their time cleaning the dataset and transform them into a format with which they can work with. In fact, data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning the data.

A very common scenario is that the dataset contains missing values coded as NaN. Also, the missing values are coded in different ways. The dataset may contain negative or invalid values. It may contain outliers. It may be in the untidy format. All of these are examples of a messy dataset.

In this project, I present several useful ways to handle messy and missing values in the dataset.
